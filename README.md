For my Favorite Website, I have chosen to recreate a simplified version of MyTutor using Bootstrap. I made sure my project is organized with all necessary files (html, css, js, images) included and properly named.

I started with creating a Navigation Bar with Home Page, three links (How it Works, Prices, Contact), and one dropdown link item (Find a Tutor) using a navbar-toggler. I ensured the navbar is responsive across different screen sizes using Bootstrapâ€™s built-in responsiveness.

For my Home Page I included images with headings to them, and a hero section to introduce the site. I also added Bootstrap Accordions for FAQs.

For the How it Works Page I used Bootstrap Cards to display features of MyTutor services. I applied CSS hover effects for better visuality.

For the Prices Page I included a table to display subjects, tutors and price lists. For the price list I used Bootstrap Modals for pop-ups. I added Payment & Policies section as a footer, and Follow Us icons by side.

Finally, for the Contact Us Page I added a Validated Contact form with name, e-mail and message fields, and a secondary Bootstrap button. I also added social media icons (Fb, IG, X) leading to actual websites links.

In a separate file I wrote 4 JavaScript Functions which I think would be relevant to my Website. My first JS function validates if a phone number matches a specific format.

Second JS function adds a new tutor to the tutors array and print a message about the new tutor added.

Third JS function takes two arguments: hourly rate and the number of hours for the tutoring session, and it returns the total price by multiplying them.

And the last JS function adds the message to the feedback array and returns it.
